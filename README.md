# Google Interview


In my opinion, Google Interview is all about luck! Well, I will tell you the reason!

In other companies, interview is like - they will ask one question and you fail to answer that question at first attempt! You go back and study that question and clear your next interview when the same question is asked! In general, if you consider normal programming question, you may get OOPS Concepts, String Reverse, etc. This you can study/prepare and clear your interview after 1st or 2nd attempts.
